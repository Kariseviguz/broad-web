            <p class="blog-info"> We are people that
                    
                love to travel   around ther World!!!
                    
               </p>
               <p>    I think I have a pretty good travel blog. (You probably do too if you’re here.) I work hard to provide excellent practical 
                travel advice to help you travel better, but I’m not the only great travel blogger out there. In fact — and I know this might be shocking — there’s a lot about travel that I’m not an expert on. Family travel? No idea. Travel as a woman? Clueless. Information 
                on hotels? Only a little. Photography? I can manage to turn my camera on if that counts. Food expert? Only at eating it.</p>


                <p>
                    Lets us tell you our experience  <a href="https://www.volunteerworld.com/en/filter?f%5BcC%5D=068&f%5BtagG%5D=Language+Course"> HERE</a>

                </p>
                 

                <p> When one has the desire to study there are several topics that one should think about, especially if it will be the first time traveling alone, or
                     going to another country with another language and culture.
                    There are many issues such as the visa, where it has an expiration time and once finished, you must return to 
                    your country, unless you can find a company that hires you, giving you a work visa.
                    Then we have housing, transportation, in some countries like Europe it is not necessary to have a private vehicle, 
                    but in the case of the USA yes. since the distances are long. Also the issue of food can be very different since unlike Latin America the food is more concentrated.

                                <p> In the morning, after you had breakfast with your host family, you get in the trufi (the common public transport) to your project. As always, there is rush hour and traffic
                                     but you get to chitchat with the locals. You stop at hard ware shop to buy materials, because you had a project planned and already 
                                    gathered a group of volunteering kids around you. You want to paint one of the community rooms. So you prepare it to paint and a father of one of the kids, helps you to clean 
                                    and get everything out so you can start.

                                    After school the kids drop in and a small group needs desperate help to catch up in English. You play simple conversation games and memory. 
                                    As you promised you bought some paint you start to paint with the kids, and there is one wall, they can paint as they like. It's getting chaotic because now every one wants to help and paint.
                                    
                                    The afternoon passes quickly and at 5PM you take a Bus to the language school, because you decided to continue with Spanish classes in the evenings. 
                                    There is not much time to grab a bite on the way, but you get there in time, even though its rush hour again. You had the plan to meet up with friends for cinema later that night, but you decide to call it a day, because it is just the beginning of the week and you are tired as hell.
